                Hello! My name is Megan Hastings and I have just started to dip my toe into this world of computers. Prior to this I received my Bachelors of Science in Biology with a wildlife focus in 2017. That ended up not really working out as a career financially
                so I've been taking various Al La Cart courses from Bellevue College to try and find a new path. In my free time I enjoy hiking, bird watching, gaming, and cooking. I have two cats named Tilde and Oedipus who are my pride and joy. I gained
                a fascination with skulls during my work in Portland State University’s Natural History Museum and now have a collection of 13+ animal skulls (humanely sourced).

                Here are some snippets of a playlist my fiancé made for me of some of his favorite IDM artists which makes for great ambient music while working or doing homework.
